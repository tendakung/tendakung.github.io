My essential goal of teaching is to enable students to reasonably perceive and explore the world in the hope that they will have a wonderful life journey in the future. To achieve this, I help my students acquire knowledge, develop application skills, and raise their awareness of the world in each course. During the five years of teaching practice, I have gradually learned how to help students grasp knowledge and gain application skills in an inclusive learning environment. This is largely reflected in their rising evaluations of my teaching effectiveness as a teaching assistant for various undergraduate and graduate courses as shown in Table 1 below. And it was not until recently, when I started teaching undergraduate econometrics as an associate instructor, that I deeply realized that raising students’ awareness of social issues is not a burden but a delight for them. It has become the most effective teaching approach to attract students’ attention and boost their learning in my class. In the following, I will illustrate my teaching methods and evidence of their effectiveness based on my recent experience in the undergraduate course Econometric Theory and Applications as a teacher.
