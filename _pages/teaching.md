My essential goal of teaching is to enable students to reasonably perceive and explore the world in the hope that they will have a wonderful life journey in the future. To achieve this, I help my students acquire knowledge, develop application skills, and raise their awareness of the world in each course. During the five years of teaching practice, I have gradually learned how to help students grasp knowledge and gain application skills in an inclusive learning environment. This is largely reflected in their rising evaluations of my teaching effectiveness as shown below. For more details, please check my teaching statement [here](/files/pdf/teaching/TS.pdf).
