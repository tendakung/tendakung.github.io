My essential goal in teaching is to enable students to perceive and explore the world reasonably. To achieve this, I help my students acquire essential knowledge, develop application skills, and raise their awareness of social issues. During the five years of teaching practice, I have gradually learned how to create an effective and inclusive learning environment for students with diverse backgrounds. This is reflected in the studentsâ€™ rising evaluations of my teaching effectiveness in the five undergraduate and graduate courses listed below. For details about my teaching methods and their effectiveness, please check my teaching statement [here](/files/pdf/teaching/TS.pdf).
