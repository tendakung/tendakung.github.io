My essential goal in teaching is to enable students to reasonably perceive and explore the world in the hope that they will have a wonderful life journey in the future. To achieve this, I help my students acquire knowledge, develop application skills, and raise their awareness of nationwide and worldwide issues like climate change. During the five years of teaching practice, I have gradually learned how to create an effective and inclusive learning environment for students with diverse backgrounds. This is largely reflected in the rising students' evaluations of my overall teaching effectiveness in several undergraduate and graduate courses listed below. For details about my teaching methods and their effectiveness, please check my teaching statement [here](/files/pdf/teaching/TS.pdf).
