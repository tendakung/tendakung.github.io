## Working Papers

### Job Market Paper: [The Contemporaneous Interaction between the Investment and Rental-supply Effects of Higher Land Ownership Security and its Welfare Implications.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16LQOFofVSFpIlqZPztmELl0LvJEt3EXo/view?usp=sharing) 
> Securing land ownership has long been supposed to bring about significant gains in both agricultural output and poverty reduction for an unequal agrarian economy by boosting land-attached investments and increasing land rental supply to facilitate land access for the poor who have relatively abundant family labor that is more efficient than hired labor due to the agency cost. However, this paper shows that the moral hazard of tenants not taking care of landlords’ land-attached capital, resulting from non-security barriers to long-term land rental contracts, will downsize these win-win economic gains. It induces the bias of the investment effect of higher land ownership security towards the endowed land to be self-cultivated and thus attenuates the concurrent rental-supply effect. The attenuated rental-supply effect will limit not only the improvement in labor efficiency but also the size of the investment effect through the complementarity between attached capital and labor inputs in the farm production. The scaledown of these two effects leads to notably smaller welfare gains than expected for a typical unequal agrarian economy like the rural Nicaragua, as evidenced by comprehensive numerical simulations.


### The Risk of Tenants Squatting Landlords’ Land and Aggregate Labor Productivity: Theory and Evidence from the Dominican Republic.(<em>forthcoming</em>)
> This paper studies the impact of securing land ownership on the labor allocation between the agriculture and non-agriculture sectors and its implication for aggregate labor productivity in countries like the Dominican Republic, where tenants can successfully squat the rented land from landlords. Theoretical and simulation analyses suggest that removing the ownership risk from tenants will eliminate the sectoral labor misallocation and thus increase aggregate labor productivity. The economic mechanism behind it is that workers will choose sectoral occupations following their comparative advantages without fear of losing the land to be rented out or hope for squatting the land to be rented in.


## Work in Progress

### Cyclical and Trend Variations in Demand Elasticity: Scanner Data Evidence from US Grocery Stores. Coauthored with [Bulat Gafarov](https://are.ucdavis.edu/people/faculty/bulat-gafarov/) and [Jens Hilscher](https://are.ucdavis.edu/people/faculty/jens-hilscher/).
> Based on the IRI and Nielsen retail scanner data, we document common cyclical and trend variations in store-residual demand elasticities for groceries across the U.S. in the last two decades. We identify supply shocks of a specific product sold by a specific store in a market of interest by using the volume-weighted average weekly prices of the same product sold in a geographically neighboring market as the price IV. We control demand shocks using multi-way fixed effects of product, store, and week. Our IV estimates of annual residual demand elasticities exhibit a downward trend of 0.04 per year and a cyclical variation of 0.08 per year in magnitude. Using supplementary data, we find suggestive evidence that the downward trend echoes the rising market concentration in the U.S. retail sector while the cyclical variation reflects the dynamics of consumers’ purchasing power over business cycles.
