> This paper documents substantial time variations in price elasticities of demand
and implied markups for the US food retail sector. First, we employ a Hausmantype IV to estimate store-level own-price elasticities at the market-good-year level, using scanner data of US grocery stores from 2001 to 2020. Then, we efficiently aggregate these data annually to estimate a common trend and cyclical variation in elasticities. Finally, we impute nationwide store-level price-cost markups from
annual elasticities under a standard optimal pricing rule. We find (i) a long-run increase in US grocery store markups of 3.9% per year in the past two decades and (ii) a short-term decrease of 13.6% per year during aggregate demand contractions. We show the underlying elasticities are largely driven by economic and market factors, such as real GDP, housing prices, population, and product differentiation.

### [Agricultural Production] The countervailing interaction between the investment and rental-supply effects of securing land ownership: Theory and evidence from Nicaragua.

> Securing land ownership has been hypothesized to bring about significant gains in both agricultural output and poverty reduction for rural economies endowed with unequal land ownership distributions. However, these win-win economic gains largely hinge on the premise that security improvement will simultaneously boost land-attached investments and increase land rental supply to facilitate land access for the poor. This paper argues that in theory, non-security barriers to long-term land rental contracts could break this premise by causing a countervailing interaction between the investment and rental-supply effects of securing land ownership. I provide suggestive evidence from Nicaragua, one of the poorest countries in Latin America. Recent panel data of rural household surveys show that after an improvement in land ownership security, previously-credit-unconstrained households significantly increased land-attached investments but not rented-out land, while previously-credit-constrained households did the opposite. These two groups of households had similar demographics, such as land and labor endowments, though.
