> This paper documents substantial time variation in price elasticities of demand and therefore markups. We propose a two-step procedure to identify time-varying markups. Using the scanner data of US grocery stores from 2001 to 2020 we first estimate elasticities at the market-good-year level. We then efficiently aggregate these data by year to estimate a common trend and cyclical variation in elasticities and impute markups from there. We estimate (i) a secular increase in U.S. grocery store markups of 3.9% per year over the sample period and (ii) an average 13.6% cyclical decline at times of aggregate demand contractions. Our results imply pro-cyclical changes in markups. Across markets, elasticities vary with market-wide factors that we expect to influence preferences and market structureâ€”real GDP, unemployment, and market concentration.

### The countervailing interaction between the investment and rental-supply effects of higher land ownership security: Theory and evidence from Nicaragua. Available upon request.
> Securing land ownership has been hypothesized to bring about significant gains in both agricultural output and poverty reduction for a rural economy endowed with unequal land ownership distribution. These winwin economic gains largely hinge on the following premise: Security improvement can simultaneously boost land-attached investments and increase land rental supply to facilitate land access for the poor. This paper argues that, in theory, non-security barriers to long-term land rental contracts could break this premise by causing a countervailing interaction between the investment and rental-supply effects of securing land ownership. I provide suggestive empirical evidence from Nicaragua, one of the poorest countries in Latin
America. Recent household survey data in rural Nicaragua show: After an improvement in land ownership security, previously credit-unconstrained farmers are more likely to make land-attached investments but not rent out land, while previously credit-constrained farmers are more likely to do the opposite.
