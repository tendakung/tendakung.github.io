## Working Papers

#### Job Market Paper: The Contemporaneous Interaction between the Investment and Rental-supply Effects of Higher Land Ownership Security and its Welfare Implications. 
> Securing land ownership has long been supposed to bring about significant gains in both agricultural output and poverty reduction for an unequal agrarian economy by boosting land-attached investments and increasing land rental supply to facilitate land access for the poor who have relatively abundant family labor that is more efficient than hired labor due to the agency cost. However, this paper shows that the moral hazard of tenants not taking care of landlords’ land-attached capital, resulting
from non-security barriers to long-term land rental contracts, will downsize these win-win economic gains. It induces the bias of the investment effect of higher land ownership security towards the endowed land to be self-cultivated and thus attenuates the concurrent rental-supply effect. The attenuated rental-supply effect will limit not only the improvement in labor efficiency but also the size of the investment effect through the complementarity between attached capital and labor inputs in the farm production. The scaledown of these two effects leads to notably smaller welfare gains than expected, as evidenced by comprehensive numerical simulations.
