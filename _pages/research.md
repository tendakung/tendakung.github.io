> This paper documents substantial time variation in price elasticities of demand and therefore markups. We propose a two-step procedure to identify time-varying markups. Using the scanner data of US grocery stores from 2001 to 2020 we first estimate elasticities at the market-good-year level. We then efficiently aggregate these data by year to estimate a common trend and cyclical variation in elasticities and impute markups from there. We estimate (i) a secular increase in U.S. grocery store markups of 3.9% per year over the sample period and (ii) an average 13.6% cyclical decline at times of aggregate demand contractions. Our results imply pro-cyclical changes in markups. Across markets, elasticities vary with market-wide factors that we expect to influence preferences and market structureâ€”real GDP, unemployment, and market concentration.

### The countervailing interaction between the investment and rental-supply effects of higher land ownership security and its welfare implications. You may download the paper [here](/files/pdf/research/securitypaper.pdf).
> Securing land ownership is hypothesized to bring about significant gains in both agricultural output and poverty reduction for an agrarian economy endowed with unequal land ownership distribution. These win-win economic gains hinge on the premise that the security improvement can simultaneously boost land-attached capital investments and increase land rental supply to facilitate land access for the poor. By renting in more land, the poor can earn higher incomes by working more on their own farms as family labor which is more efficient than hired labor due to the agency cost. However, this paper argues that non-security barriers to long-term land rental contracts, which causes capital depreciation risk for the rented-out land, can downsize these economic gains. Theoretically, the capital depreciation risk induces the bias of the investment effect of higher land ownership security towards the endowed land to be self-cultivated, which tends to attenuate the concurrent rental-supply effect. The smaller increase in land rental supply will limit not only the improvement in labor efficiency but also the size of the investment effect through the complementarity between attached capital and labor inputs in farm production, leading to smaller welfare gains than expected, especially the welfare gain for the poor.
