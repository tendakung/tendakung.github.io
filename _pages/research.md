> This paper documents substantial time variation in price elasticities of demand and therefore markups. We propose a two-step procedure to identify time-varying markups. Using the scanner data of US grocery stores from 2001 to 2020 we first estimate elasticities at the market-good-year level. We then efficiently aggregate these data by year to estimate a common trend and cyclical variation in elasticities and impute markups from there. We estimate (i) a secular increase in U.S. grocery store markups of 3.9% per year over the sample period and (ii) an average 13.6% cyclical decline at times of aggregate demand contractions. Our results imply pro-cyclical changes in markups. Across markets, elasticities vary with market-wide factors that we expect to influence preferences and market structureâ€”real GDP, unemployment, and market concentration.

### The countervailing interaction between the investment and rental-supply effects of higher land ownership security: Theory and evidence from Nicaragua. <i>Forthcoming.</i>
> Securing land ownership has been hypothesized to bring about significant gains in both agricultural output and poverty reduction for a rural economy endowed with unequal land ownership distribution. These win-win economic gains hinge on the premise that the security improvement can simultaneously boost land-attached capital investments and increase land rental supply to facilitate land access for the poor. This paper argues that, in theory, non-security barriers to long-term land rental contracts can downsize these economic gains by causing a countervailing interaction between the investment and rental-supply effects, as evidenced by numerical simulations. Empirically, I provide suggestive evidence from Nicaragua, one of the poorest countries in Latin America. The panel household survey data shows that previously credit-unconstrained farmers are more likely to make land-attached capital investments but less likely to rent out land after the security improvement, while previously credit-constrained farmers are more likely to do the opposite.
