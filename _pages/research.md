> This paper documents substantial time variations in price elasticities of demand
and implied markups for the US food retail sector. First, we employ a Hausmantype IV to estimate store-level own-price elasticities at the market-good-year level, using scanner data of US grocery stores from 2001 to 2020. Then, we efficiently aggregate these data annually to estimate a common trend and cyclical variation in elasticities. Finally, we impute nationwide store-level price-cost markups from
annual elasticities under a standard optimal pricing rule. We find (i) a long-run increase in US grocery store markups of 3.9% per year in the past two decades and (ii) a short-term decrease of 13.6% per year during aggregate demand contractions. We show the underlying elasticities are largely driven by economic and market factors, such as real GDP, housing prices, population, and product differentiation.

> Securing land ownership has long been hypothesized to bring about significant gains in both agricultural output and poverty reduction for rural economies endowed with unequal land ownership distributions. However, these win-win economic gains largely hinge on the premise that security improvement will simultaneously boost land-attached investments and increase land rental supply to facilitate land access for the rural poor. This paper argues that non-security barriers to long-term land rental contracts could break this premise by causing a countervailing interaction between the investment and rental-supply effects of securing land ownership. I provide suggestive evidence from Nicaragua, one of the poorest countries in Latin America. Recent panel data of rural household surveys show that after a plausibly exogenous improvement in land ownership security, previously-credit-unconstrained households significantly increased land-attached investments but not rented-out land, while previously-credit-constrained households did the opposite. These findings hold even for matched households based on their initial likelihood of being credit-constrained.

### The countervailing investment and rental-supply effects of securing land ownership: Numerical evidence on welfare implications.

> Securing land ownership can simultaneously boost land-attached investments and increase land rental supply to facilitate land access for the poor. However, Gong(2024) demonstrates that the investment effect will attenuate the concurrent rental-supply effect when non-security barriers to long-term land rental contracts are present. Importantly, the author argues that the attenuated rental-supply effect will lead to smaller welfare gains than expected for rural economies endowed with unequal land ownership distributions. This paper employs a multi-agent simulation approach to investigate the extent to which welfare gains may be downsized for a typical unequal rural economy. Numerical results show that relative to the ideal case of no non-security barriers to long-term land rental contracts, after land ownership is fully secured: (i) the operational land under rental may experience a substantially smaller expansion or even a shrinkage; (ii) the wage rate may increase by a significantly smaller percentage point accordingly; and (iii) both land-attached investments and agricultural output, however, may only witness a slightly smaller but still sizable increment. These findings indicate that non-security barriers to long-term land rental contracts may disproportionately diminish the welfare gain for the poor generated from securing land ownership.
