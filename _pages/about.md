&nbsp; &nbsp; I am a Ph.D. candidate in Agricultural and Development Economics at [the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics, University of California, Davis](https://are.ucdavis.edu/people/grad-students/phd/tengda-gong/). My primary research interest lies in how institutions and market mechanisms affect resource allocation and social welfare. My job market paper studies demand dynamics in the US food retail sector and the associated changes in markups. My other dissertation work studies the impact of securing land ownership on the allocations of land, capital, and labor and its welfare implications in Latin America and the Caribbean. Part of my research agenda is investigating the interactions among climate change, institutions and market mechanisms and their social and environmental consequences.
