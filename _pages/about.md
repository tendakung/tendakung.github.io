<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I am a Ph.D. candidate in Agricultural and Development Economics at [University of California, Davis](https://are.ucdavis.edu/people/grad-students/phd/tengda-gong/). My primary research interest lies in how institutions and market mechanisms affect resource allocation and social welfare through both production and consumption. My job market paper studies demand dynamics in the US food retail sector and the implied changes in markups. My other dissertation work studies the effect of securing land ownership on land, capital, and labor allocations and its welfare implications for rural households in Latin America and the Caribbean. Part of my ongoing works are investigating the interactions among climate change, institutions and market mechanisms and their social and environmental consequences.
