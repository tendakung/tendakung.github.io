<br>
I am a PhD candidate in development economics at University of California, Davis. My research interest mostly lies in how institutions affect resource allocation, structural transformation, and social welfare. Currently, I am working on impacts of improving the security of land property rights on land and labor allocations and their welfare implications for the poor in an unequal agrarian economy under the guidance of [Michael R. Carter](https://are.ucdavis.edu/people/faculty/michael-carter/) and [Stephen R. Boucher](https://are.ucdavis.edu/people/faculty/steve-boucher/).
