I am a Ph.D. candidate in Development and Agricultural Economics at [the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics, University of California, Davis](https://are.ucdavis.edu/people/grad-students/phd/tengda-gong/). My research interest primarily lies in how institutions affect resource allocation and social welfare, especially in the process of structural transformation and climate change. Currently, I am studying impacts of securing land ownership on land, capital, and labor allocations within and beyond the agriculture sector and their productivity and welfare implications for an economy endowed with an unequal landownership distribution like many countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, under the guidance of [Michael R. Carter](https://are.ucdavis.edu/people/faculty/michael-carter/), [Stephen R. Boucher](https://are.ucdavis.edu/people/faculty/steve-boucher/), and [Dalia Ghanem](https://are.ucdavis.edu/people/faculty/dalia-ghanem/).
