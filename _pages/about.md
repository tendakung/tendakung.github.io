<br>
I am a [Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics at the University of California, Davis](https://are.ucdavis.edu/people/grad-students/phd/tengda-gong/), working on policy-relevant issues in Agricultural and Development Economics as well as Environmental Economics. 
<br>
<br> 
Much of my research is tied together by my primary interest in how market mechanisms and institutions affect resource allocation and social welfare in a changing world with various market imperfections. An important part of my research is to study the dynamics, resilience, and justice of the US food system throughout socioeconomic development and climate change. Another research line is to study agricultural growth, poverty dynamics, and environmental degradation in Latin America and the Caribbean where the agricultural production system has been experiencing structural transformations due to institutional reforms and climate change.

My job market paper studies demand dynamics in the US food retail sector and the implied markup changes. My other dissertation work studies the effects of securing land ownership on land, capital, and labor allocations and their implications for agricultural growth and poverty reduction in Latin America and the Caribbean. My ongoing projects are investigating the interactions among climate change, institutions, and market mechanisms and their socioeconomic and environmental consequences.
