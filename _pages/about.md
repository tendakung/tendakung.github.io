I am a Ph.D. candidate in Development and Agricultural Economics at [the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics, University of California, Davis](https://are.ucdavis.edu/people/grad-students/phd/tengda-gong/). My primary research interest lies in how institutions affect resource allocation and social welfare during structural transformation. Currently, I am studying impacts of securing land ownership on land, capital, and labor allocations and their productivity and welfare implications for an economy endowed with unequal landownership distribution like many countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, under the guidance of [Michael R. Carter](https://are.ucdavis.edu/people/faculty/michael-carter/), [Stephen R. Boucher](https://are.ucdavis.edu/people/faculty/steve-boucher/), and [Dalia Ghanem](https://are.ucdavis.edu/people/faculty/dalia-ghanem/). Another component of my research agenda is investigating the interactions between institutions and climate change and the associated environmental consequences, e.g., one of my ongong works studies the unintended effect of Brazil's environment-oriented credit policy on the drought-induced deforestation in the Amazon Biome.
