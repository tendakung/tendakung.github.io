I am a Ph.D. candidate in Development and Agricultural Economics at [the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics, University of California, Davis](https://are.ucdavis.edu/people/grad-students/phd/tengda-gong/). My research interest primarily lies in how institutions affect resource allocation and social welfare throughout the process of structural transformation. Currently, I am working on impacts of securing land ownership on land, capital, and labor allocations and their implications for agricultural output and the wage rate of farm labor in an unequal agrarian economy under the guidance of [Michael R. Carter](https://are.ucdavis.edu/people/faculty/michael-carter/) and [Stephen R. Boucher](https://are.ucdavis.edu/people/faculty/steve-boucher/).
