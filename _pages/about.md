I am a Ph.D. candidate in Development and Agricultural Economics at [the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics, University of California, Davis](https://are.ucdavis.edu/people/grad-students/phd/tengda-gong/). My primary research interest lies in how institutions affect resource allocation and social welfare during structural transformation and climate change.  Currently, I am studying impacts of securing land ownership on land, capital, and labor allocations within and beyond the agriculture sector and their productivity and welfare implications for an economy endowed with unequal landownership distribution like many countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, under the guidance of [Michael R. Carter](https://are.ucdavis.edu/people/faculty/michael-carter/), [Stephen R. Boucher](https://are.ucdavis.edu/people/faculty/steve-boucher/), and [Dalia Ghanem](https://are.ucdavis.edu/people/faculty/dalia-ghanem/). Another component of my research agenda is investigating the interactions between institutions and climate change and the associated economic and environmental consequences, e.g., one of my ongong works studies the unintended effect of an environment-oriented credit policy in Brazil on the drought-induced deforestation in the Amazon Biome, which is more pronounced in municipalities with salient small-scale farms.
