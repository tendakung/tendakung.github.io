<br>
I am a [Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics at the University of California, Davis](https://are.ucdavis.edu/people/grad-students/phd/tengda-gong/), working on policy-relevant issues in Agricultural and Development Economics as well as Environmental Economics. 
<br>
<br> 
My primary interest lies in how market mechanisms and institutions affect resource allocation and social welfare in a changing world with various market imperfections. One part of my research is to study the dynamics, resilience, and justice of the US food system throughout socioeconomic development and climate change. Another research line is to study agricultural growth, poverty dynamics, and environmental degradation in Latin America and the Caribbean where the agricultural production system has been experiencing structural transformations due to institutional reforms and climate change. You may see details like my JMP in the research section.
