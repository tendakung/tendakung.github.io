I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics at the University of California, Davis. My research focuses on understanding how public policies and market mechanisms affect the functioning of agrifood systems amid market imperfections and climate change. I will join the Department of Agribusiness and Agricultural Economics at the University of Manitoba as an Assistant Professor in Fall 2024.
