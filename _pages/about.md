<br>
I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Agribusiness and Agricultural Economics at the University of Manitoba, Canada. I got my Ph.D. in Agricultural and Development Economics from the University of California, Davis in 2024. My research focuses on understanding how public policies and market mechanisms affect the functioning of agrifood systems amid market imperfections and climate change, and its welfare implications.
