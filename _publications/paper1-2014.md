excerpt: 'This paper studies how the adoption of mechanization services on <i>tiliu tian</i> (large and non-fragmented farmland) helps boosting transfers of <i>chengbao tian</i> (small and fragmented farmland) in China. Economic analysis based on self-collected household surveys in Anhui Province suggests that mechanization services expand from the former to the latter as they are geographically close to each other, which lowers labor cost of cultivating small fragmented farmland in scale and thereby boosts farmland transfers among heterogeneous households.'
