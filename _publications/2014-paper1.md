>This paper studies how the adoption of mechanization services on <i>tiliu tian</i> (large and non-fragmented farmland) helps boosting transfers of <i>chengbao tian</i> (small and fragmented farmland) in China. Self-conducted household surveys and interviews in Anhui Province suggest that the mechanization services initiated from the former farmland expand to the latter farmland as they are geographically close to each other. This lowers the labor cost of cultivating small fragmented farmland in scale and thereby boosts transfers of <i>chengbao tian</i> among heterogeneous households.
